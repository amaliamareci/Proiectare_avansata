In addition to the time cost, each link between two network nodes has a probability of failure. You may want to read this.

Implement an efficient agorithm to determine the safest route for a packet to travel between two given nodes.

Generate random network instances with known optimum and test your algorithm using JUnit or other framework.(i didn't do this one )

I used the same algorithm of Dijkstra makink the new_cost=(cost*probability of failure) to find the minimum cost and path
