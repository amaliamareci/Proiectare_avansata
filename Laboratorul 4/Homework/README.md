Homework (2p)

Create a class that describes the city.

Using Java Stream API, write a query that display all the streets that are longer than a specified value and join at least 3 streets.

Use a third-party library in order to generate random fake names for intersections and streets.

You may use this package of JGraphT in order to solve the problem (or other library).

Note: A personal implementation of the algorithm will be will be scored extra (+1p).

The Prim algorithm is implemented in class MinTree  and the random names for the streets and intersections are implemented in CityGenerator
